# About

Twig.js is a pure JavaScript implementation of the Twig PHP templating language
(http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)

The goal is to provide a library that is compatable with both browsers and
node.js.

Twig.js is currently a work in progress and supports a limited subset of the
Twig templating language (with more coming).

Supported tags:

* if / elseif / else / endif
* for / else / endfor
* set

Filters are not yet supported, but most of the expression syntax is implemented.
