# About

Twig.js is a pure JavaScript implementation of the Twig PHP templating language
(<http://twig.sensiolabs.org/>)

The goal is to provide a library that is compatable with both browsers and server side containers such as node.js.

Twig.js is currently a work in progress and supports a limited subset
of the Twig templating language (with more coming).

Supported tags:

* if / elseif / else / endif
* for / else / endfor
* set

A limited set of filters are supported (with more coming) and most of the expression syntax is implemented.
